        <h1>Goals</h1>
        <p>Hello, my name is Shinni, but I go by the name Hana. I was born on April 5th, 2005. I am a transgender female with various aspirations and interests. Currently residing in Bulgaria, I appreciate the country's charm but seek to leave due to many reasons, including encountering narrow-minded/closed-minded attitudes, a lack of professional doctors, and insufficient support for the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
<p>My journey involves focusing on my transition, including seeking to obtain prescribed hormone replacement therapy. Upon relocating, I plan to undergo surgeries such as bottom surgery, Adam's apple reduction, voice feminization, and potentially facial feminization.</p>
<p>In addition to my transition journey, I am committed to self-improvement and education. I am dedicated to learning coding languages and expanding my skills in various areas. My ultimate goal is to enroll at Malta University, and I am working towards achieving the necessary qualifications, including taking the IELTS exam.</p>
<p>In the future, I aspire to work in the field of technology and pursue interests in cosplay and content creation as a Vtuber. You can find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/ShinniOffical">here</a>.</p>
