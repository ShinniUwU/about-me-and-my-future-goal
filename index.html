            <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">Hello, my name is Shinni, but I go by the name Hana. I was born on April 5th, 2005. I am a transgender female with various aspirations and interests. Currently residing in Bulgaria, I appreciate the country's charm but seek to leave for several reasons, including encountering narrow-minded or closed-minded attitudes, a lack of professional doctors, and insufficient support for the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">My journey involves focusing on my transition. Upon relocating, I plan to undergo surgeries such as bottom surgery, Adam's apple reduction, voice feminization, and potentially facial feminization. Additionally, I want to explore the possibility of having ASD.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">In addition to my transition journey, I am committed to self-improvement and education. I am dedicated to learning coding languages and expanding my skills in various areas. My ultimate goal is to enroll at Malta University, and I am currently working towards achieving the necessary qualifications, including taking the IELTS exam.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">In the future, I aspire to work in the field of technology and pursue interests in cosplay and content creation as a Vtuber.</p>
