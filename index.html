        Hello, cuties my nickname is Shinni and I was born on April 5th, 2005. I am a transgender male to female who has various mental problems such as gender dysphoria, PTSD, RLS, and anxiety both of which anxiety and PTSD come from school. I currently live in Bulgaria and I don't like the closed/narrow-minded people here don't get me wrong the country is amazing and I kinda love the old/poor feel to it  but I can't continue living here Hormonal replacement therapy is unaccessible and I don't trust the doctors here since I had a terrible experience with them I prefer to be taken somewhere where I can be seen by a real professional I am planning to get surgeries like bottom surgery, adam apple reduction surgery, voice feminization surgery maybe face feminization surgery and start feminizing hormone therapy when I move out of this country
While I am here I am going to try my best to not suicide or harm myself and get scholarships and as many certificates, as I can right now I am planning to get a certificate for knowing how to code and understand coding languages such as javascript, CSS, HTML

In the future, I want to become a system administrator, Cosplayer, and a vtuber :3
